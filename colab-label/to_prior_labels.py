"""Convert `run_labels.py` output rows into the row shape `tools/build_prior_lookup.py` consumes.

`run_labels.py` writes {id, family, score, n, out_per_gen, gens:[{text, tokens, correct}]}.
`build_prior_lookup.py` reads {id, family, score, n, out_tokens_total, sc}, where

  * `score` is None (-> -1.0 in the table) when the item has no public gold answer, so that
    items we cannot judge still contribute length and consistency, and
  * `sc` is self-consistency: the share of the n generations whose extracted final answer
    equals the modal answer.  It needs no gold answer, which is what lifted E53's Dev
    coverage from 0.69 to 0.91.

Usage:
    python to_prior_labels.py IN.jsonl OUT.jsonl [--model TAG]
